Description:
This exercise was meant to learn better how to receive an input from the user, and work with
arrays, pointers and such.
Firstly, after getting the input, I had to make an array of double from an array of chars.
The validity checks that were necessary made the code look not so elegant, but had to be done.
After creating 2 arrays with double elements, the process started - first, center the arrays
so that the elements are in the center of the array. After that I had to normalize the values
in the arrays so they will sum up to 1. Then the convolution had to be done. I used swap function
in order to make convolution between g*h and place it in a result array, and normalize it.
The swap was in order to now make the convolution between the next h and the g*h, which was placed
in another array in the first place, and the swap was helping me running the convolution in a loop.
According to the normalized result, the print of asterisk was made, as they represented the weight
of each element of the array.
